# Bootstrap v2

`v2.exe` (not checked in) is the output of the `v1fromv1.exe` compiler as run on the concatenation
of the source files in this directory. `v2.d` is generated by the bazel
target `:v2d` in the [BUILD file](BUILD) in this directory.

`v2fromv2.exe` is the output of the d2-written compiler (`v2.exe`) as run
on `v2.d`.

They produce identical output!

## Features

`v2` supports everything that [v1 supports](../v1/README.md#features), plus:
   * Implemented with records, which allows unlimited number of globals, strings, procs, params
   * `exit "message"`
   * Implemented with `println`
   * Fixed bug with arrays of records

It does not yet support:
   * Unlimited number of locals
   * Arrays within records
   * Comparing strings via `<` or `>`
   * `>>` `<<` `++` `--` operators
   * `extern` or `main` keywords
   * "Bit" operators (`&`, `|`, `!`, `^`)
   * `long`, `double`, `byte` data types
