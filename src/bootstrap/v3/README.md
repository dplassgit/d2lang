# Bootstrap v3

`v3.exe` (not checked in) is the output of the `v2fromv2.exe` compiler as run on the concatenation
of the source files in this directory. `v3.d` is generated by the bazel
target `:v3d` in the [BUILD file](BUILD) in this directory.

`v3fromv3.exe` (not checked in) is the output of the v3 compiler (`v3.exe`) as run
on `v3.d`.

## Features

   * `++` and `--`
   * Comparing strings via `<` or `>`
   * Setting strings to null
   * Unlimited number of records
   * Array literals

It does not yet support:
   * Unlimited number of locals
   * Arrays within records
   * `>>` `<<` operators
   * `extern` or `main` keywords
   * "Bit" operators (`&`, `|`, `!`, `^`)
   * `long`, `double`, `byte` data types
